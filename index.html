            <div class="about-me__body">
                <p>Dora Colquhoun is an energetic and enthusiastic neurodiverse performer, devisor
                    and
                    facilitator based in Liverpool. She recently completed a Masters in Applied Theatre with practices
                    in
                    criminal justice at Royal Central School of Speech and Drama (2019).</p>
                <p> During her masters Dora worked
                    with
                    Haringey Council leading a project in care homes across Tottenham with participants about place and
                    identity. Dora also facilitated on a violence prevention course with Unlocked Theatre at Liverpool
                    HMP.
                    In June 2019 Dora had the dream opportunity to train on 4 month residency in Vermont USA with not
                    for
                    profit theatre organisation Bread and Puppet.</p>

                <p>In 2018, Dora worked as a Mediator for the Liverpool Biennial, designing bespoke workshops and tours
                    at
                    St Georges Hall, The Bluecoat, and Liverpool Playhouse responding to the Biennial theme ‘Beautiful
                    World
                    Where Are You?.’</p>
                <p> Dora was commissioned by the Liverpool Biennial to create the event ‘Beautiful
                    woman
                    where are you?’ a series of talks collaborating with local female artists to discuss their
                    experience of
                    being a woman in the arts.</p>

                <p>Dora has a background in facilitation teaching in Croatia with TRY (The Rijeka Youth Theatre) in
                    2017.
                    Dora has extensive experience working in children’s theatre having toured intensively for 6 months
                    across Italy with Theatrino theatre (2016)</p>

                <p>In 2014 Dora completed the Hope Street Emerging Artist Program an intensive acting program devising
                    and
                    performing outdoor and site specific work. Dora Collaborated with Tate Liverpool, Liverpool Council,
                    Adam McGuigan and Barefeet theatre.</p>



                <p>Dora has wealth of varied experience as a theatre maker and entertainer she graduated from Dartington
                    College of Arts in 2011 with a first class BA Hons in Contemporary Performance Art Combining
                    Community
                    Practices.</p>
                <p> Since graduating from Dartington she has been influenced by their progressive inter
                    disciplinary teaching methods. Dora has always strived to collaborate with other artists/experts
                    from a
                    variety of disciplines as she feels this adds dimensions and an extension of knowledge to the work.
                </p>
                <p>Alongside being an actor she has a passion for devising, song writing and physical comedy having
                    completed workshops with Performers Playground (2018), collaborating with Mark Winstanley and Alice

                    Cbeebies, Action Transport Theatre, Wild Rumpus, and Coco Loco. </p>

                <img src="images/adhd.webp" alt="adhd: the musical poster" class="adhd">
                <p>The project ADHD The Musical: Can I Have Your Attention Please? Was born from my personal experience
                    being assessed for ADHD. At the age of 30, this is considered a late diagnosis; not that I was late
                    for my diagnosis, I made sure I was on time!</p>

                <p>I sat with the information that I had ADHD for a year like a mother duck sitting on an egg. Then one
                    day whilst cycling along the Liverpool to Leeds canal I decided I needed a neuroscientist!</p>

                <p>I contacted neuroscientist Dr Joydeep Bhattacharya and began having conversations with him about the
                    brain. My conversations with Dr Joy inspired me to create a musical performance lecture. I combined
                    my love of musical theatre and Ted Talks to make an experience that was entertaining, informative
                    and heartfelt.</p>

                <p>The piece ADHD The Musical explores the highs and lows of having the most common neuro-developmental
                    disorder worldwide alongside good old fashioned storytelling, singing, and dancing with inspiration
                    from legends Julie Andrews, Dolly and Cher.</p>

                <p>The show attempts to unpack feelings of shame and blame that occur when being neuro- divergent in a
                    world designed for the neuro typical brain.</p>

                <p>I am delighted to be awarded by the Arts Council funding 2021 and be supported Dadafest. I am looking
                    for places, festivals and venues to showcase the piece.</p>
