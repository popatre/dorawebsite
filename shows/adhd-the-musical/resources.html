                            having ADHD especially when trying to navigate in a
                            world designed for neurotypical minds. Shame tends

                            with ADHD due to behaviors such as these:

                            When I first got my diagnosis, I felt a feeling of
                            shame that my brain was different! But the more I
                            learned about ADHD, the more I realized I needed to
                            be kinder to myself and take positive steps to
                            understand the challenges and work with information.
                            Knowledge is power.

                            about and then communicate that to those around you.

                                    Body doubling is a productivity strategy in
