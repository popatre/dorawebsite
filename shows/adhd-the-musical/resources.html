                    <h2>Lets start with SHAME!</h2>
                    <p>
                        In the show we talk about the Big Bear of Shame. In
                        fact, he is there the whole time like an unwanted guest
                        that won’t leave! Shame is a big part of having ADHD
                        especially when trying to navigate in a world designed
                        for neurotypical minds. Shame tends to appear as a
                        starring role in the lives of people with ADHD due to
                        behaviors such as these:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Being late</li>
                        <li>Being forgetful</li>
                        <li>Overly sensitive/trouble regulating emotions</li>
                        <li>Impulsive</li>
                        <li>
                            Struggling to finish important tasks… just to name a
                            few.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>How do we defeat shame like in this picture?</p>

                    <img src="" alt="OTHER PIC" />
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>Top Shame researcher Brene Brown says:</p>
                        <p>
                            "Shame hates it when we reach out and tell our
                            story. It hates having words wrapped around it - it
                            can't survive being shared. Shame loves secrecy."

                        ADHD impacts every aspect of a person's life, and can
                        have challenging outcomes
                    </h2>
                    <p>Here are some challenging facts:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            People with ADHD are 70 percent more likely to have
                            problems with addiction
                        </li>
                        <li>60 percent more likely to be fired from a job</li>
                        <li>
                            Are 3 times more likely to be in debt than those who
                            do not have ADHD.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        It’s important to be honest about the challenges people
                        with ADHD face. Openly identifying the challenges is the
                        first step to getting support.
                    </p>

                    <img src="" alt="OTHER PIC" />
                    <p>
                        When I first got my diagnosis, I felt a feeling of shame
                        that my brain was different! But the more I learned
                        about ADHD, the more I realized I needed to be kinder to
                        myself and take positive steps to understand the
                        challenges and work with information. Knowledge is
                        power.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Start with being honest about what you feel shame about
                        and then communicate that to those around you.

                            The message in this Ted Talk really influenced ADHD
                            the Musical and encouraged me to be brave and honest
                            which is a sign of strength not weakness!

                        <h3>Tools to get things done!</h3>
                        <p>
                            People with ADHD are renowned for putting tasks off
                            or leaning things to the last minute. But have you
                            heard of body doubling! Body doubling is a
                            productivity strategy in which another person works
                            alongside you as you complete a task you might
                            otherwise find challenging. Having someone nearby
                            may help you stay focused, engaged, or motivated to
                            finish the job.

                            Exercise has been one of the most effective tools

                            improve brain function and mood. Understandably it
                            can be hard getting started when you are
                            experiencing overwhelm or lack of motivation so find

                            Saturday and is great to run with a group! The best
                            part of it is feeling smug you have done your daily

                                The app's wide variety of guided meditations,
                                sleep stories, and music may help you feel more
                                relaxed. I love the masterclasses with lots of
                                inspiring speakers. It’s great if you feel
                                overwhelmed and need to take 5 mins to meditate
                                or do a breathing exercise, pop a meditation on
                                go for a walk or sit in the park.
