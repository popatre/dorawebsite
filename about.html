                        audience and getting them to do things.’ Dora studied a
                        BA in Contemporary Performance Art at radical art school
                        Dartington College Of Arts. This training has been the
                        foundation of her arts practice; creating
                        interdisciplinary, collaborative, devised work.

                        Dora has recently completed touring ADHD The Musical

                        successful and toured sell-out shows across 10 venues
                        across the UK.

                                    way of looking at things, and through
                                    careful foolery she finds ways of making

                                    playful, surreal and clever. 'Think Duck,

                                <h5>Artistic Director of Wake The Beast</h5>
                                <p>
                                    Dora has the magic alchemy of being a
                                    stunning performer, ingenious deviser whilst
                                    being expertly aware of the bigger picture
                                    of a project. Dora never plays it safe, she
                                    always pushes to make work which is
                                    political, relevant, timely and HILARIOUS!
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Dora is one of the most charming, funny,
                                    dynamic and adventurous artists I have
                                    worked with. She rose to every challenge put
                                    in front of her- and then raised the game
                                    for everyone else in the space (including
                                    the director) .  Dora puts her heart into
                                    every piece she works on and I know ADHD:
                                    The Musical; can I have our attention
                                    please, will become a trailblazing
                                    production to highlight the holistic
                                    experience of people with ADHD.  I would
                                    work again with Dora in an instant and hope
                                    to for many years to come
