                                way of looking at things, and through

                                Dora has the magic alchemy of being a
                                stunning performer, ingenious deviser whilst

                                of a project. Dora never plays it safe, she
                                always pushes to make work which is
                                political, relevant, timely and HILARIOUS!

                                Dora is one of the most charming, funny,
                                dynamic and adventurous artists I have
                                worked with. She rose to every challenge put
                                in front of her- and then raised the game
                                for everyone else in the space (including
                                the director) .  Dora puts her heart into
                                every piece she works on and I know ADHD:
                                The Musical; can I have our attention
                                please, will become a trailblazing
                                production to highlight the holistic
                                experience of people with ADHD.  I would
                                work again with Dora in an instant and hope
                                to for many years to come
